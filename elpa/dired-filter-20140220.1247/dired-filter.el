For filters where the reverse behaviour makes more sense as
default, you can set the `:remove' argument to `t' to flip the
truth value by default.  Do not flip the value in the predicate
itself!

DOCUMENTATION is the documentation of the created filter.

BODY should contain forms which will be evaluated to test whether
or not a particular file should be displayed or not.  The forms
in BODY will be evaluated with FILE-NAME bound to the file name,
and QUALIFIER bound to the current argument of the filter.
During the evaluation point is at the beginning of line.

:description is a short description of this filter (usually one
or two words).

:reader is a form that is used by `interactive' to read optional
argument.  If not specified or nil, the filter does not accept
argument from user.

:qualifier-description is a form to format qualifier for display.

:remove reverses the default matching strategy of the filter."
